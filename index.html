                    Welcome to NYC Food & Health, your ultimate tool for exploring restaurant options through an engaging, data-driven experience. Our platform combines map-based exploration with interactive data visualizations to help you identify and compare restaurants in your current location or specific destinations for future planning. View restaurants displayed on a map, where a simple hover reveals essential details like name, rating, and cuisine type. Use toggle options to compare neighborhoods or boroughs by average rating or inspection score.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    With our interactive bar chart, you can explore the distribution of cuisines within selected areas and dive deeper by selecting bars to see restaurants within specific cuisine categories in your chosen borough or neighborhood. Clicking into a specific restaurant reveals comprehensive details, including review counts and inspection scores over time. Dive into historical inspection data to view total violations, violations per inspection, and score changes across inspections, providing insights into the consistency and quality of restaurant standards. Final Vis Collection empowers you to make informed dining decisions with ease and confidence.

                    Our project brings together a robust dataset by joining information from multiple sources, using address as the primary key to link and integrate details seamlessly. We are sourcing NYC restaurant data from Kaggle, specifically from a dataset created by user beridzeg45, which provides key information on restaurant names, ratings, and cuisine types. Additionally, we are incorporating inspection results from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) New York City Restaurant Inspection Results, accessible through NYC Open Data. This data includes valuable insights into inspection scores, violation details, and trends over time. By merging these datasets, we aim to provide a comprehensive, reliable resource for exploring and comparing dining options across New York City.
